    <p>Weather can be defined as the condition of the atmosphere at a certain time and place. It can be hot, cold, wet,
        or dry. Weather is always changing, and it is affected by many factors, such as air pressure, temperature,
        humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

        There are many different types of weather conditions, including but not limited to thunderstorms, blizzards, ice
        storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes. The study of weather is called meteorology. Meteorologists use instruments to
        measure various aspects of the weather formation.
